<div style="text-align: center;"><h1>This is a simple recepie book react-native expo app created based on instamobile free

template.</h1><</div>

     It has the latest dependencies updates due to 23 december 2024 which includes termination of global expo cli support so it should run localy with no problem by "yarn install" -> "npx expo start" I also added burger menu icon on recepies and ingredients screens to avoid "wikipedia effect"
