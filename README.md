# This is a simple recepie book react-native expo app created based on instamobile free template

# It includes the latest dependency updates as of December 23, 2024, which also marks the termination of global Expo CLI support. The project should run locally without issues by following these steps:
	#1.	Run yarn install.
	2.	Start the project with npx expo start.

# Additionally, I added a burger menu icon to the recipes and ingredients screens to prevent the “Wikipedia effect.”
